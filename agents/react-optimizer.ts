    âœ… Recommendations:
      - Use React.memo for heavy components
      - Enable lazy loading with React.lazy + Suspense
      - Check bundle size with "webpack-bundle-analyzer"
      - Remove unused dependencies
      - Optimize images (WebP/AVIF)
      - Enable tree-shaking in your build

    âš¡ Expected result: ~30% bundle size reduction
