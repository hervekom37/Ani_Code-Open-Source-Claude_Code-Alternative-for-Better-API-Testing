## Common Issues

### 2025-08-14 - 2025-08-14T16:10:04.071Z
Fixed critical issues with the 3D Portfolio Generator:

**Issues Identified:**
1. Three.js CDN links were incorrect/unreliable for OrbitControls
2. No proper error handling for initialization failures
3. Missing fallback options for troubleshooting
4. No timeout handling for long loading times

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. Created local `orbit-controls.js` file to avoid CDN dependency issues
2. Added comprehensive error handling with timeout detection
3. Created `test.html` for basic Three.js functionality verification
4. Created `simple-demo.html` as a working minimal version
5. Added `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with detailed debugging guide
6. Improved error messages with actionable solutions
7. Added loading screen hints with links to test pages

**File Structure Now Includes:**
- `index.html` - Main full-featured application
- `simple-demo.html` - Minimal working 3D portfolio demo  
- `test.html` - Three.js and WebGL compatibility test
- `js/orbit-controls.js` - Local OrbitControls implementation
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive debugging guide

**Key Improvements:**
- Self-contained local OrbitControls (no external dependency)
- 15-second initialization timeout with helpful error messages
- Progressive fallback system (main app → simple demo → test page)
- Debug mode auto-enables on localhost
- Better error reporting with specific solutions
- Browser compatibility checking and guidance

The application now has multiple fallback levels and should work reliably even if some components fail to load.
